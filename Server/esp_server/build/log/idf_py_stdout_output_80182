I'm learning about prime numbers in number theory. The number 73 is especially unique as it is the 21st prime and the 21st prime number is.. wait for it..... 37!! 
that is a coincidental mirror but you want to take it one step further? the number 73 writtin in binary is also a Palindrome! No wonder it's such a special number.


anyways, heres the man output for ssh I couldn't figure it out last time so maybe I'll learn how to read one day and the man pages are actually gonna be useful.

DESCRIPTION
     ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts
     over an insecure network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

     ssh connects and logs into the specified destination, which may be specified as either [user@]hostname or a URI of the form ssh://[user@]hostname[:port].  The user must prove their identity to the re‐
     mote machine using one of several methods (see below).

     If a command is specified, it will be executed on the remote host instead of a login shell.  A complete command line may be specified as command, or it may have additional arguments.  If su

pplied, the
     arguments will be appended to the command, separated by spaces, before it is sent to the server to be executed.

     The options are as follows:

     -4      Forces ssh to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      Forces ssh to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -A      Enables forwarding of connections from an authentication agent such as ssh-agent(1).  This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration file.

             Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the agent's UNIX-domain socket) can access the local agent through the
             forwarded connection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent, however they can perform operations on the keys that enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded into
             the agent.  A safer alternative may be to use a jump host (see -J).

     -a      Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

     -b bind_address
             Use bind_address on the local machine as the source address of the connection.  Only useful on systems with more than one address.

     -C      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and data for forwarded X11, TCP and UNIX-domain connections).  The compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1).  Compres‐
             sion is desirable on modem lines and other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis in the configuration files;
             see the Compression option in ssh_config(5).

     -c cipher_spec
             Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.  cipher_spec is a comma-separated list of ciphers listed in order of preference.  See the Ciphers keyword in ssh_c

     -D [bind_address:]port
             Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding.  This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a
             connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.  Cur‐
             rently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act as a SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.  Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in the configu‐
             ration file.

             IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.  By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the
             GatewayPorts setting.  However, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the c
