# Setting Up Non-Volatile Memory 
___

The entry point of the application serves to carry out three main tasks. Firstly, the app instantiates **Non-Volatile Storage (*Flash Memory*)** utilizing [[nvs_flash.h]].

> [!note] **Error Handling Convention**  
> Throughout our server, we utilize an instance of `esp_err_t ret` to store any potential errors that may occur during the process of instantiating the Bluetooth server. For example:  
> 
> ```c
> esp_err_t ret;
> ret = nvs_flash_init();  // Attempt to instantiate the Non-Volatile Storage
> if (ret == ESP_ERR_NVS_NO_FREE_PAGES || ret == ESP_ERR_NVS_NEW_VERSION_FOUND) {
>     ESP_ERROR_CHECK(nvs_flash_erase());
>     ret = nvs_flash_init();
> }
> ESP_ERROR_CHECK(ret);
> ```
> By following this approach, we can easily check whether an error has occurred anywhere within the code and log it accordingly using `ESP_LOGE()`.
