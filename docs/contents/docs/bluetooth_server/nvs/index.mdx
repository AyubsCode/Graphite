# Setting Up Non-Volatile Memory 
___

The entry point of the application serves to carry out three main tasks. Firstly, the app instantiates **Non-Volatile Storage (*Flash Memory*)** utilizing  functions defined within the `nvs_flash.h` header file .

 Throughout our server, we utilize an instance of `esp_err_t ret` to store any potential errors that may occur during the process of instantiating the Bluetooth server. For example:  
 
 ```c
 esp_err_t ret;
 ret = nvs_flash_init();  // Attempt to instantiate the Non-Volatile Storage
 if (ret == ESP_ERR_NVS_NO_FREE_PAGES || ret == ESP_ERR_NVS_NEW_VERSION_FOUND) {
     ESP_ERROR_CHECK(nvs_flash_erase());
     ret = nvs_flash_init();
 }
 ESP_ERROR_CHECK(ret);
 ```
The `Non-Volatile Memory` is necessary as the ESP32 requires it to store PHY calibration data as well as key-value pairs across reboots .
