### 1.2 Background

<div>
  <p>The demand for storage on personal devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops has increased in proportion to the increase in data produced and consumed over the years . Despite this growing need, most consumer devices come with fixed internal storage capacities that cannot be expanded post-purchase.</p>
  <p>Historically, expandable storage solutions like microSD cards were common in smartphones, allowing users to augment their storage as they desired. However, modern device designs have stripped users of this ability in favor of delivering sleek designs , often at the cost of expandable storage. As a result, consumers are frequently forced to choose between deleting valuable data, upgrading to a more expensive device, or subscribing to recurring cloud storage plans. Each of these options come with their own respective drawbacks. The disparity between the declining cost of memory hardware and the inflated pricing for storage upgrades on consumer devices gives way for innovation. Through the utilization of wireless connectivity, stream processing systems, and secure data transmission , a viable pathway for creating alternative storage solutions that blend affordability, scalability, and user control can be created .</p>
  <p>This project emerges from a vision to bridge this gap. By combining a cross-platform software application with a portable hardware component, it aims to provide users with a seamless, wireless means of expanding their device storage.</p>
