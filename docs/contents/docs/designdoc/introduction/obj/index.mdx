### 1.4 Objective

Our goal for this project is to deliver a fully functional, mobile-centric storage solution that integrates seamlessly with modern smartphones and tablets. The system will consist of a portable hardware unit and a mobile application, providing users with a wireless, secure, and user-friendly means of expanding their device storage without relying on costly internal upgrades or recurring cloud subscriptions.

The mobile application will be designed with simplicity and usability in mind, following the design principles and aesthetic standards of current mobile operating systems. By leveraging best practices in mobile app development, we aim to create an intuitive interface that ensures effortless setup, reliable connectivity, and smooth file management.

A key milestone for this project is to deliver a beta version of the system by the end of the academic semester. This beta will enable initial testing and feedback from users, allowing us to refine the app's functionality, performance, and user experience before the final release.
