### 3. High-Level Design 

#### **3.1 Block Diagram**


#### **3.2 Application Programming Interface**
 
#### **3.2.1 I/O APIs**
The following is an abstract example of the *Application Programming Interface*.. 
####  1. Uploading a  File 

-   **Endpoint:** `POST /file`
-   **Request Body:**
    
    ```json
    {
      "filename": "string",
      "createdOnInUTC": "long",
      "createdBy": "string",
      "updatedOnInUTC": "long",
      "updatedBy": "string"
    }
    
    ```
   
    
-   **Response:**
    
    ```json
    {
	  "isViable" : "bool" 
      "uploadStatus": "string",
    }
    
    ```
    
-   **Process:**
    -   This operation involves a two-step process:
        1.  File metadata is stored locally .
        2.  The actual file upload begins.
    ---

####  2. Uploading a  File 

-   **Endpoint:** `GET fileId`
-   **Response:**
    
    ```json
    {
      "fileId": "string",
      "downloadUrl": "string",
      "isViable" : "bool", 
      "streamStatus" : "double" 
    }
    
    ```
    It should be taken into account that `fileId` is the absolute path to the file in question . 
    
    ---
#### **3. Delete File**

-   **Endpoint:** `DELETE fileId`
-   **Details:**
    -   Deletes the file from the hardware's flash and its associated metadata from the device .

    ---

#### **4. Get Latest Snapshot**

-   **Endpoint:** `GET /folders/{folderId}?startIndex={startIndex}&limit={limit}`
-   **Response:**
    
    ```json
    {
      "folderId": "string",
      "fileList": [
        {
          "fileId": "string",
          "filename": "string",
          "thumbnail_img": "string",
          "lastModifiedDateInUTC": "string",
          "creationDateInUTC": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
    
    ```
    
-   **Details:**
    -   Provides a paginated list of files within a specified folder.
    -   Data is fetched dynamically as the user scrolls to optimize performance for folders with many files.

----------

#### **Design Considerations**

   - Metadata and other relevant data must be stored on the device locally.
